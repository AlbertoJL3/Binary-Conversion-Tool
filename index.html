            <h2>Binary History</h2>
            <p>The binary number system has been the most impactful numerical system in the history of technological
                development. Over hundreds of years, discoveries within binary theory led to the invention of electric
                circuitry and, consequently, the first computer ENIAC, seventy years ago.

                Who discovered binary code? The discovery of the binary system is mainly attributed to Gottfried Wilhelm
                Leibniz in the 17th century. In his paper “Explanation of Binary Arithmetic”, Leibniz proposed a binary
                digit system. However, earlier civilizations in Egypt and China used the binary system for rudimentary
                counting and arithmetic. </p>
            <p>The binary numeral system is a positional number system represented by only two symbols – 0 and 1. The
                radix of the binary number system is 2, and this means that only two numeric values can appear in any
                representation of a number. The binary system is used by computers and electronic devices to store data
                and perform computations.

                The decimal system, which we use every day, works on a system where every value has its own unique
                symbol from 0 – 9. People have always used the decimal number system because it is straight to the point
                and easy to understand. There are different ways to represent this base-10 numeral system: the
                Hindu-Arabic numerals we use, Roman numerals, and Brahmi numerals.

                Then, there is also the hexadecimal system. It is a combination of decimal digits and English letters
                (known as ASCII in computer science). It has 16 possible values – numbers from 0 – 9 and letters from A
                – F (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F). Hexadecimal numbers are used in computer
                programming to represent URI’s and color codes. For example, the color white has a hex code of #FFFFFF
                and the color black has a hex code of #000000. </p>
