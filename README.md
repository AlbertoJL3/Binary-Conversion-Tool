# Binary-Conversion-Tool
The goal of this project is to create a simple interactive site for converting binary to normal digits or hexadecimals. This is just a fun little tool that I  wanted to develop for myself as a coding challenge. It will also work as a guide with general knowledge about hexadecimals, binary numbers, and the mathematical history of them.
