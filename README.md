## Description
The Goal of this project is to test my knowledge of binary numbers, and the hexadecimal system by creating an interactive site for converting digits to binary numbers and binary to hexadecimals. This site is a simple HTML/CSS/JS stack with no backend. This is merely a quick little fun coding challenge using built-in javascript functions. This project validates user inputs using regex and simple logic.

## Art 
If you're curious about the background of the page, I've made it my signature style to add my creative inspiration for projects as part of the page, in this case I put a page from my engineering journal that contained the information I learned on binary and hexadecimals. 
## Tests 
Test by stress testing it with some hexadecimals!
